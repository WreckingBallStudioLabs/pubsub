// The PubSub interface is a programming construct in Go that provides a way for components in a
// distributed system to communicate with each other asynchronously using a publish-subscribe messaging pattern.
// This interface defines a set of methods that allow a client to publish messages to a topic and
// subscribe to receive messages from a topic. The PubSub interface is useful in scenarios where multiple components
// need to be able to send and receive messages in a loosely-coupled manner, without having to
// know the details of each other's implementation.
//
// To use the PubSub interface, a client would first create an instance of an implementation of the
// interface that is specific to the messaging system being used, such as NATS or Redis. The client would then
// use this instance to publish messages to topics and subscribe to receive messages from topics.
// When a message is published to a topic, all clients that are subscribed to that topic will receive the message.
// This allows components to communicate with each other without having to know the specific details
// of who they are communicating with.
//
// The PubSub interface has a general purpose of enabling communication and coordination between components
// in a distributed system. It provides a flexible and scalable way for components to send and receive
// messages asynchronously, which can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as event-driven architectures,
// microservices, and real-time applications. The interface also allows for easy integration with different
// messaging systems, making it possible to switch between messaging systems without having to change the
// code that uses the interface.
